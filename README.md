Hi, I'm Josh Berkman!

I'm an artist turned coder. Well, I'm still an artist. I've just taken an interest in coding.
My main focus is websites, but I also have an interest in games.

Currently I'm trying to build a portfolio for coding, but if you have an interest in working
with me, hiring me, or there is just some glaring error in my code that I didn't catch, you can 
reach me at either:
  josh@berkmananimation.com
  or
  berkmananimation@gmail.com
